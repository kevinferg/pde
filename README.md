# Interactive PDE Visualizer
Visualize and interact with PDEs. Made in C with raylib.  

Equations implemented so far:
- Swift-Hohenberg Equation
- Cahn-Hilliard Equation

## Controls
- Scroll mouse wheel to change brush size
- Left (or right) mouse click to 'paint' negative (or positive) values at the cursor
- Spacebar to pause/resume simulation
- Tab to switch equations

## Compilation
Set up raylib as described [here](raylib/README.md). Then build with `make` and run `./bin/main`.
